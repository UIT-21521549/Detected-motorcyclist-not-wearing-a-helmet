# Detected-motorcyclist-not-wearing-a-helmet.
In this article I want to detect motorcyclists who do not wear helmets with real time. Build a real-time system for traffic. I use Yolov8 for detect and Spark combine Kafka to take a data real time from camera trafic.
### Step 1: I trained yolov8 with my dataset in google colab, then i take a model and use that for detection helmet and no-helmet
